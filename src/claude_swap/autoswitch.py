"""Auto-switch engine: poll usage, switch accounts before they hit rate limits.

``AutoSwitchEngine`` is UI-agnostic — no printing, no argparse, no TUI
imports. It composes a :class:`ClaudeAccountSwitcher`, evaluates a threshold
policy each :meth:`~AutoSwitchEngine.tick`, and reports everything through
typed events handed to an ``on_event`` callback; the CLI renders them as
human lines or JSONL, and any future frontend (TUI dashboard, menubar) can
consume the same stream.

Policy in one paragraph: when the active account's *binding window* (the
higher of its 5h/7d utilization) crosses ``settings.threshold``, switch to
the candidate with the most headroom — proactively, so the old account is
still valid while a running Claude Code picks the new one up (this is what
makes the macOS ~30s Keychain cache latency harmless). Candidates must sit
``hysteresis_pct`` below the threshold so two accounts hovering at the line
never ping-pong, and a ``cooldown_seconds`` floor bounds the switch rate
(bypassed only when the active account is hard at its limit). Voluntary
switches also wait for session-traffic silence (the quiet gate): every org
has its own prompt-cache namespace, so a swap under live traffic full-misses
the next turn of every running session — proactive switches are held until
no ``~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`` transcript has been written for
``QUIET_WINDOW_S`` (by then those caches have expired on their own);
at-limit and failover are escapes and ignore the gate. Before
activation the target's token is *freshened* (refreshed if it expires within
10 minutes — twice Claude Code's refresh buffer, so a running Claude Code's
under-lock re-read sees a fresh token and aborts its own refresh); a target
whose refresh token is dead gets quarantined instead of activated. When the
active account's own usage becomes unreadable for ``unhealthy_ticks``
consecutive ticks, the engine fails over to any healthy candidate.

Cooldown and quarantine persist in ``<backup_root>/autoswitch_state.json``
(so cron-driven ``cswap auto --once`` ticks behave across processes), mutated
read-modify-write under a dedicated file lock.

# CONSECUTIVE not-busy polls. At the gate's poll spacing (the ~30s tick
# interval; 60s for cron --once) 3 polls are a ≥60s sustained turn
# boundary, which no sub-second blip can fake: at the episode's own cadence
# (a tool round per ~3s) even a generous 10%-per-poll blip chance compounds

        # need the pinned model — so the escape bought the terminal nothing

        # three moves in a day, one Fable slot lost for two days; the owner's
        # third "the active login is always on 32"). The only voluntary way

        near the band) plus ONE due candidate (the one with the stalest data
        — never-fetched first, then oldest fetch); everyone else is served

        utilization within ``ESCALATION_MARGIN_PCT`` of the threshold, or
        active usage unknown (failover must not run on stale candidate data).
        At-limit, proactive, and ordinary unknown-usage failover selection

        without escalating). The consume-first trigger can fire outside the

        collection and re-verifies the choice in ``_tick_inner`` (two-phase
        commit), plus a per-target ``UsageEntry.fresh`` gate before
        performing.

        Stalest-first needs no rotation cursor: it reads the persisted store,
        so the loop and cron-driven ``--once`` runs schedule identically.
        Backoff (``backoffUntil``) is enforced by the collector even for the
        active account — a Retry-After must never be defeated — and during an
        idle-hold no candidate is polled at all (slow crawl for everything).
        Adapted cadences are persisted by the collector itself after each
        fetch (shared with every other surface), not by the engine.

        ``active_headroom`` is the binding-window headroom of the account
        being left (None = unknown). At or under 0 the wait is skipped

        froze four sessions on a one-shot wave — CON-451), and an episode
