# claude-swap

Multi-account switcher for Claude Code. Easily switch between multiple Claude accounts without logging out, or let it switch for you before you hit a rate limit. Track usage for every account in a live dashboard, and run accounts in parallel. Works with both the Claude Code CLI and the VS Code extension.

## Installation

### Local preferred-account adaptation

This checkout adds `autoswitch.homeMode=prefer`. Set a managed account as
`autoswitch.homeAccount` and choose `prefer` to use it while it has quota, switch
to eligible fallbacks in account sequence, and return after its quota recovers.
The original `pin` mode remains the default.

```sh
cswap config set autoswitch.homeAccount your-primary@example.com
cswap config set autoswitch.homeMode prefer
cswap config set autoswitch.threshold 95
cswap config set autoswitch.switchUnderLoad true
cswap config set autoswitch.intervalSeconds 15
```

Returning requires headroom at least `100 - threshold + hysteresisPct`; this
avoids switching back and forth on tiny quota changes. The first observation
after a reported reset is scheduled promptly, while provider backoff and
concurrent polling claims remain respected. An elapsed reset alone never counts
as available quota. Configured model limits also apply.

Switching changes the login used by subsequent requests without restarting
Claude Code. macOS normally takes up to approximately 30 seconds to refresh its
Keychain cache. A turn already halted by Claude Code's quota waiter may still
need a manual continuation; proactive switching reduces, but cannot eliminate,
that case. This local adaptation also serializes active credential writes with
Claude Code's secure-store lock and preserves concurrently updated MCP logins.

Local verification and operational notes are in [LOCAL-SETUP.md](LOCAL-SETUP.md).
Do not replace this checkout with the similarly named PyPI distribution when
updating: it does not necessarily include this policy.

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install claude-swap
```

### Using pipx

```bash
pipx install claude-swap
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap.git
cd claude-swap
uv sync
uv run cswap help
```

### Updating

```bash
cswap upgrade          # uv/pipx installs on macOS/Linux: auto-detects and upgrades
# or run your installer directly:
uv tool upgrade claude-swap
pipx upgrade claude-swap
```

## Usage

### Add your first account

Log into Claude Code with your first account, then:

```bash
cswap add
```

### Add more accounts

Log in with another account, then:

```bash
cswap add
```

`add` only registers the account: the previously active account gets the live
login back, so running sessions (and their warm prompt cache) are not swapped
mid-flight — rotation onto the new account happens through `switch`/auto-switch.
Pass `--activate` to consciously make the new account live right away.

### Switch accounts

Rotate to the next account:

```bash
cswap switch
```

Or switch to a specific account:

```bash
cswap switch 2
cswap switch user@example.com
cswap switch dev                # or by alias, once set with `cswap alias 2 dev`
```

Not sure which one? `cswap list` is the dashboard — every account's 5-hour and 7-day usage and reset times at a glance:

```bash
cswap list
```

Or let claude-swap auto-pick by remaining quota — `cswap switch --strategy best` (most quota left) or `--strategy next-available` (skip rate-limited accounts).

A switch onto an account that is running a live [session-mode](#run-multiple-accounts-at-the-same-time-session-mode) terminal on its stored login is **refused** (the error names the PIDs): the default login and the session would share one rotating refresh token in two stores, and the session loses its login at the next rotation. Work under that account with `cswap run N` instead, or pass `cswap switch N --even-if-live` to switch anyway (the session keeps running until its token rotates). Sessions on an attached setup-token or on an API-key account don't share the login, so they only get a notice. Auto-switch applies the same rule: it never rotates onto — or returns home to — an account whose live sessions run on its login, but a token or API-key account with live sessions stays a valid target.

**Note:** You usually don't need to restart — on Linux/Windows the new account is picked up automatically, and on macOS after the Keychain cache expires. To apply it instantly, restart Claude Code or reopen the VS Code extension tab. See [Tips](#tips) for the per-platform details.

### Automatic switching

Let claude-swap watch your usage and switch for you. When the active account's 5-hour or 7-day window reaches the threshold (default 90%), it switches to the account with the most quota left — before you hit the limit, and safe to run while Claude Code is working:

```bash
cswap auto                     # foreground loop, polls every 60s
cswap auto --threshold 80      # switch earlier
cswap auto --model Fable       # also switch when the Fable weekly limit is hit
cswap auto --once              # single check-and-switch, for cron/scripts
cswap auto --dry-run           # log what it would do, never switch
cswap auto --strategy consume-first   # burn the soonest-resetting account first
```

<details>
<summary>How it behaves & advanced usage</summary>

- Runs safely alongside Claude Code: switches take the same credential locks Claude Code uses, so a swap never collides with a token refresh.
- A cooldown (default 5 min) and a hysteresis margin stop it flip-flopping near the threshold: a proactive switch only lands on an account that's below the threshold *and* better than the current one by the margin — a candidate that clears the margin is always taken, but two accounts hovering at the line never ping-pong. When every account is exhausted it keeps checking on a bounded slow cadence, waking sooner for an imminent reset.
- **Strategies** (`--strategy`, or `cswap config set autoswitch.strategy`): `best` (default) stays put until the active account nears its limit, then moves to the account with the most quota left. `consume-first` proactively keeps you on the account whose **weekly window resets soonest** — use-it-or-lose-it — switching to a sooner-resetting account (with room to spare) even below the threshold, so perishable weekly quota isn't wasted.
- A proactive switch waits for five minutes of session silence (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` mtime), because prompt caches are per-organization and a swap under live traffic full-misses the next turn of every running session. That gate assumes someone is at the keyboard between turns. An **unattended fleet never goes quiet** — the gate then holds the swap until the account hits the wall and only the forced at-limit escape gets out, after in-flight agents have already failed on the limit. `cswap config set autoswitch.switchUnderLoad true` releases the at-threshold switch to land under traffic: you pay the prompt caches of the sessions on the account you leave, instead of paying with dead agents. The below-threshold `consume-first` rotation is pure optimization and keeps waiting for silence under either setting. Leave it off for interactive work.
- `autoswitch.drainTimeoutSeconds` bounds the damage of **forced** switches (at-limit, failover, and the at-threshold switch under `switchUnderLoad`): instead of landing at the first busy tick, the swap *drains* — holds while re-checking for the same five minutes of transcript silence on every poll — and at the ceiling goes through anyway with a warning, because an account pinned at its limit breaks live agents harder than a cache miss does. Each waiting tick logs a `no-switch` with reason `drain-wait`; a switch that waited carries an additive `drain: {outcome: "go"|"timeout", waitedSeconds}`; hitting the ceiling emits one `drain-timeout` warning event per episode. `0` (the default) keeps forced switches immediate. The wait state lives in `autoswitch_state.json`, so cron `--once` ticks share the same episode.
- `autoswitch.drain2WaitSeconds` upgrades the at-threshold (`switchUnderLoad`) switch from *waiting for* a pause to *creating* one (drain v2): the engine messages every mid-turn background session to finish its current step, checkpoint, and freeze (delivered by a one-shot headless `claude -p` herald via SendMessage, listed in the session roster as `Jerry`), confirms each one reached a turn boundary from the `claude agents --json` roster — machine confirmation, not a timer — swaps, verifies the new account's usage is readable, and messages the frozen sessions to resume (waking an idle session starts its next turn, so each agent pays one cold cache write on the new account). Sessions still mid-turn after this many seconds are swapped under force and counted in the switch event's additive `drain2: {outcome: "ready"|"timeout", waitedSeconds, fixed, forced}`. Any channel failure logs `drain2-unavailable` and falls back to the passive drain above. `0` (the default) keeps drain v2 off. At-limit and failover always use the passive drain — at the hard limit, calls are already failing.
- **Migration price** (why timing matters): prompt caches don't cross organizations, so a swap makes every live session re-create its whole context at full price on its next call — the cost of a swap is the **sum of the live contexts** on the account you leave, and it grows with the fleet. Three knobs manage it:
  - `autoswitch.earlySwapThreshold` (default `0` = off) arms an **early swap**: at/above this binding-window pct — still below `threshold` — a proactive switch fires as soon as at most `autoswitch.earlySwapMaxBusy` (default `2`) sessions are mid-turn in the `claude agents --json` roster (interactive ones count — they pay the move too). Moving two contexts at 70% is strictly cheaper than moving twelve at 90%. It is voluntary economics, not an escape: the cooldown and (without `switchUnderLoad`) the transcript-silence gate hold it, an unreadable roster declines it, and the landing must still clear the hysteresis margin, so hovering accounts never ping-pong. A quiet, empty park makes it a free relocation. Set it meaningfully below `threshold` (e.g. `70` under a `90` threshold); at or above it the normal proactive trigger fires first and the knob is inert. Each firing logs an `early-swap` event and the landed switch carries an additive `early: true`.
  - `autoswitch.drain2SmallContextTokens` (default `50000`) shapes the drain-v2 wave: a mid-turn session whose transcript shows a context at/below this many tokens is **left running through the swap** instead of being checkpointed — its post-swap cache re-create is pocket change next to the checkpoint ceremony (commit, TaskList sweep, receipt, resume) and the wall-clock it would add to the pause. Unknown contexts are checkpointed (a transcript the engine can't read could be a 900k context). Skipped names appear in the signal event's `skippedSmall`; `0` checkpoints everyone.
  - Every drain-v2 episode is **priced before its wave**: the engine reads each judged session's transcript (last usage record: `input + cache_creation + cache_read` tokens ≈ the context its next turn re-creates) and logs the sum as `estMoveTokens` with a per-session `estSessionTokens` breakdown on the `drain2-signal` event; the landed switch's `drain2` payload carries the episode total. An estimate — subagents' contexts ride in separate transcripts the roster doesn't name — but it is the number future threshold tuning judges by.
- Usage polling is adaptive — a couple of accounts per check, busy alternates watched more closely, and exhausted ones checked about every ten minutes (or slower after 429s) — so API traffic stays flat no matter how many accounts you manage.
- It fails safe: if a usage check errors it keeps trusting the last-known numbers while retries back off, and an expired token on an idle machine makes it hold rather than fail over (Claude Code refreshes the token on your next message).
- An account whose refresh token has died is quarantined and reported until you either log in with it and re-run `cswap add --slot N`, or replace its stored credentials from a known-good export — a plain `cswap import backup.cswap` replaces dead-token slots on its own (`--force` is still required to replace other existing accounts; note a stale export can carry an already-superseded token). API-key accounts are never rotated onto unless you pass `--include-api-key-accounts`.
- To hold an account out of rotation yourself — a work account you don't want touched, one you're resting — run `cswap disable <num|email>`; `cswap enable <num|email>` puts it back. Disabled accounts are skipped by auto-switch, bare `cswap switch`, and the `best` / `next-available` strategies, but stay fully managed and remain a valid explicit `cswap switch <num|email>` target. They show a `(disabled)` marker in `cswap list`, in the [TUI](#interactive-dashboard-tui), and in the [menu bar](#menu-bar-macos) — both of which also let you toggle the state in place (TUI: menu → *Disable / enable account…*; menu bar: *Disable / enable account*).
- `autoswitch.homeAccount` (or `--home <num|email>`) **pins the live login to one account**. With a home set, auto-switch never rotates off it on its own — not at the threshold, not under `consume-first`, not at an account-wide (5h/7d) limit (that wall is yours to wait out), and not when a configured `autoswitch.model` window on the home is burned either (the hold logs a `home-pinned` no-switch that names the burned window; the couriers that use the default login ride their own model ladder): the only things that move it are a dead token (the failover) and your own word — `cswap config set autoswitch.homeAccount` or `cswap disable <home>`. Away from home (after a failover or a manual `cswap switch`), it returns the moment the home account reads again — its model window is not judged — ignoring the cooldown; each return is logged as a `switch` with trigger `return-home`, and a return that cannot land yet (session traffic, a `cswap run` session holding the slot, a network blip) logs a `return-home-wait` no-switch while the normal rotation — at-limit and failover included — keeps judging the account you are on. A live `cswap run` session on the home slot holds the return indefinitely: bring the login home by hand with `cswap switch <home> --even-if-live` (with the override the switch adopts the session's newer generation into the backup instead of refusing). While the pin is active the pool-shield's burned-host preference stands down: voluntary landings are judged model-aware. The record's `activeAccountNumber` also follows the real login: a manual `/login` onto another managed account is adopted on the next tick and logged as `adopt-real-login` with both numbers. A disabled or unknown home leaves the pin inert with one `config-warning`. Meant for setups where other accounts are consumed per-terminal through `cswap run` and the default login should stay out of their way: a login that keeps rotating costs such a fleet one seat at all times.
- By default only the account-wide 5h/7d windows drive switching. If you work on one model and hit its **weekly per-model limit** first (e.g. Fable), add `--model Fable` (or `cswap config set autoswitch.model Fable`) to fold that model's window into the decision, so it switches off an account whose model quota is spent even while its 5h/7d windows still have room.
  - **Model names** are Anthropic's own per-model `display_name`s, matched case-insensitively. The exact strings for your accounts are the per-model rows in `cswap list` (e.g. a line reading `Fable: 100%`).

For cron/systemd timers, `--once` reports the outcome in its exit code (`0` switched, `1` error, `2` nothing to do, `3` blocked — no viable target), and `--json` emits one JSON event per line:

```bash
*/5 * * * * cswap auto --once --json >> ~/.cswap-auto.log 2>&1
```

Defaults like the threshold and cooldown are configurable with `cswap config set autoswitch.threshold 80` — flags override them (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

### Run multiple accounts at the same time (session mode)

Launch Claude Code as a specific account in the current terminal only — every other terminal and the VS Code extension stay on your default account, so two accounts can work in parallel.

```bash
cswap run 2                     # launch Claude Code as account 2, here only
cswap run user@example.com      # by email
cswap run 2 -- --resume         # everything after '--' is forwarded to claude
cswap run 2 --share-history     # share your chat history with this account too
```

Sessions use your normal `~/.claude` setup (settings, CLAUDE.md, skills, MCP servers, etc.), but each account keeps its own chat history — pass `--share-history` if you want your accounts to continue the same conversations.

<details>
<summary>Sharing details — MCP servers & chat history</summary>

- With `--share-history`, a session started under one account shows up in `--resume` under the others, and nothing already saved is lost.
- User-scope MCP servers (`claude mcp add -s user`) are mirrored from your default profile on every launch — manage them there; changes made inside a session don't persist. Definitions are copied as-is (including inline `env`/`headers` values), but MCP OAuth logins are not — HTTP servers may ask you to authenticate once per profile via `/mcp`.
- `--no-share` turns sharing off and removes the mirrored MCP config (profiles that never mirrored are left alone).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Recovery — a session that says "Login expired" while its stored login is newer</summary>

A session's claude rotates the token family inside its profile and nothing syncs it back; the other way round happens too: the stored login gets rewritten under a live session (a re-login with `cswap add --slot N`, a `cswap switch N --even-if-live` visit whose couriers rotated the family, a persisted rotation), and the session keeps running on the generation that rewrite consumed — "Login expired · Please run /login" at its next refresh. The profile is marked for a re-bootstrap, but that only happens once it is idle, and a profile hosting your terminal tabs never is. `cswap reseed N` closes that gap without waiting:

```bash
cswap reseed 32                 # put the stored login's newer generation into slot 32's profile
cswap reseed 32 --json          # {"reseeded": true, "from": "backup", "generation": …, "livePids": [...]}
```

It judges who ran ahead by the profile's seed stamp, never by the stale marker: a profile that rotated past the stored login is left alone (`profile-ahead` — the stored login adopts its generation instead, no grant consumed); a profile holding the consumed generation gets the stored login's `claudeAiOauth` written into its store under Claude Code's own credential locks for that profile, keeping the profile's own MCP logins; an expired stored login is refreshed first, and a rejected grant leaves the profile untouched (`relogin-required`). Live sessions are not a blocker — their PIDs are reported. Claude Code re-reads its store under its own locks before refreshing or forcing re-auth, so a live session is expected to pick the new generation up at its next such re-read — that is verified for the default `~/.claude` store, not separately for session profiles, so treat it as likely, and restart the session (`cswap run N -- --resume`) when you need certainty. The active default login is refused (`active-slot`: its live credential is Claude Code's own store and heals through the collector), as are a profile on an attached setup-token, an API-key slot and a slot without a profile (`token-profile`, `api-key`, `no-profile`); with `--json` a refusal is the usual error envelope plus `error.outcome` and `error.livePids`, exit 1.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Map accounts to directories — auto-pick per repo</summary>

Bind a directory to an account, and a bare `cswap run` there launches that account in session mode — e.g. work account in work repos, personal elsewhere:

```bash
cswap map 2 ~/work/client-app   # map a directory to account 2
cswap map user@example.com      # map the current directory
cswap map                       # list mappings
cswap unmap ~/work/client-app   # remove one (defaults to current directory)

cd ~/work/client-app/src
cswap run                       # → account 2, session mode
```

Subfolders inherit the nearest mapped ancestor. In an unmapped directory, `cswap run` just launches plain `claude` with your default login. Mappings are per-machine (not part of `cswap export`) and are cleaned up when their account is removed.

</details>

### Interactive dashboard (TUI)

Run `cswap` on its own (or `cswap tui`) for the full-screen dashboard: live usage for every account, switching, and the auto-switcher, all keyboard-driven. `cswap watch` opens it straight to the live monitor. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

<img src="assets/tui-watch.png" width="760" alt="cswap watch — live 5h/7d usage bars for every account, with reset times and the active account marked">

### Theme

The TUI ships a dark theme and a light theme, both WCAG AA-contrast checked, plus `auto` (the default), which follows the terminal's background via an OSC 11 query. Pick one from the root menu's **Theme…** entry (the current one is marked), press `Ctrl+T` inside the TUI to cycle `dark → light → auto` live, or set it up front:

```bash
cswap config set ui.theme light   # or: dark, auto
```

The plain CLI output (outside the TUI) follows the same `ui.theme` setting. With `auto`, if the terminal doesn't answer the OSC 11 query, cswap falls back to the dark palette. Inside `tmux` or `screen` (which don't pass the query through) it skips the probe entirely and uses dark, so `auto` never adds a startup delay there.

Toggling the theme live inside the TUI only affects new output — auto-view log lines already printed keep the colors they were written with; only lines added after the switch pick up the new theme.

### Refresh expired tokens

If an account's token expires, log back into Claude Code with that account and re-run:

```bash
cswap add
```

This will update the stored credentials without creating a duplicate.

### Other commands

```bash
cswap run 2                     # Run an account in this terminal only (session mode)
cswap reseed 2                  # Put the stored login's newer generation into account 2's session profile
cswap auto                      # Auto-switch when nearing rate limits (see above)
cswap config                    # Show or edit settings (see Configuration below)
cswap list                      # Show all accounts with 5h/7d usage and reset times
cswap list --token-status       # Add source-labelled OAuth token diagnostics
cswap list --json --token-status  # …machine-readable: per-account "tokenFamily"
cswap status                    # Show current account
cswap add --slot 3              # Add account to a specific slot (prompts before overwrite)
cswap add --alias dev           # Add account and give it a short alias
cswap add --activate            # Add and make it the live login immediately (logged bypass)
cswap remove 2                  # Remove an account
cswap disable 2                 # Hold an account out of auto-rotation (keeps its login)
cswap enable 2                  # Return a disabled account to rotation
cswap alias 2 dev               # Give an account a short alias (usable anywhere NUM|EMAIL is)
cswap alias 2 --unset           # Remove an account's alias
cswap alias                     # List all aliases
cswap move 2 1                  # Assign an account to a slot (relocates to an empty slot, swaps if taken)
cswap tui                       # Interactive dashboard (also: bare `cswap`)
cswap watch                     # Dashboard, opened on the live watch page
cswap upgrade                   # Upgrade claude-swap to the latest version
cswap purge                     # Remove all claude-swap data
```

The original flag spellings (`cswap --switch`, `cswap --list`, ...) keep working.

## Tips

- **Do you need to restart after switching?** Usually not. On **Linux and Windows**, credentials are stored in a file and Claude Code re-reads them whenever that file changes, so the new account takes effect on your next message — no restart needed. On **macOS**, credentials live in the Keychain, which Claude Code caches for about 30 seconds; a running session picks up the switch once that cache expires. Restart Claude Code (or close and reopen the VS Code extension tab) only if you want the change to apply instantly.
- **Continuing sessions after switching:** You can keep using the same Claude Code session after switching — run `cswap switch` in any terminal and carry on. If you'd prefer a clean start, close and reopen Claude Code (or the VS Code extension tab) and use `--resume` to pick your previous session. Either way, the first message on the new account may use extra usage as its conversation cache rebuilds.

## How it works

- Backs up OAuth tokens and config when you add an account
- Swaps only the account-specific Claude login when you switch accounts;
  live account-independent OAuth state (such as MCP server logins) is
  preserved instead of being overwritten by a slot's older snapshot
- Account credentials stored securely using platform-appropriate methods
- Switches (manual and automatic) hold Claude Code's own credential locks while writing, so a swap never interleaves with a token refresh
- Auto-switch freshens a target's token before activating it, and quarantines accounts whose refresh token has died (recover by re-adding it with `cswap add --slot N`, or by replacing its stored credentials from a known-good export — a plain `cswap import backup.cswap` replaces dead-token slots automatically)
- Usage numbers refresh every few minutes — faster for an account being used or close to switching, slower for idle ones — keeping cswap comfortably inside Anthropic's rate limits however many dashboards you keep open on a machine. An age note like `· 6m ago` just means the next scheduled check hasn't come yet, not that something is stuck.

## Data locations

| Platform | Credentials | Config backups |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Windows | File-based (inside the backup directory, under `credentials/`) | `~/.claude-swap-backup/` |
| macOS | macOS Keychain | `~/.claude-swap-backup/` |
| Linux / WSL | File-based (inside the backup directory, under `credentials/`) | `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/claude-swap/` |

Session-mode profiles (`cswap run`) live under the backup directory in `sessions/`. Tool preferences (`settings.json`) and auto-switch state (`autoswitch_state.json` — cooldown and quarantined accounts; delete it to reset) live in the backup directory root.

On Linux/WSL, set `XDG_DATA_HOME` to override the default location.

## Menu bar (macOS)

<details>
<summary>Optional macOS menu bar app — usage at a glance, click to switch</summary>

Needs the `menubar` extra (macOS only):

```bash
uv tool install 'claude-swap[menubar]'   # or: pipx install 'claude-swap[menubar]'
cswap menubar
```

Shows every account's 5h / 7d / spend usage and switches with a click (specific / rotate / best / next-available), plus the TUI's add / disable-enable / remove / refresh actions. Enable *Settings → Auto-switch accounts* to run the same engine as [`cswap auto`](#automatic-switching) in the background; it shares the `autoswitch.*` settings, so the menu bar and CLI stay in sync. Off until you turn it on.

</details>

## Advanced

### Configuration

Tool preferences live in `settings.json` in the backup root; `cswap config` reads and edits it with validation, so you never have to find the file or guess valid ranges.

<details>
<summary>Commands & usage</summary>

```bash
cswap config                              # list effective settings ("(default)" = not set)
cswap config get autoswitch.threshold
cswap config set autoswitch.threshold 80  # validated: rejects out-of-range values loudly
cswap config set autoswitch.model Fable   # per-model switching (see "auto"); Fable,Opus for several
cswap config unset autoswitch.threshold   # back to the default
cswap config path                         # where settings.json lives
```

`cswap config --help` lists every key with its valid range and default. Hand-editing the file still works — `cswap config` is just a safer front door. `list` and `get` take `--json` for scripting.

</details>

### Backup and migration

Move account data between machines or back it up:

```bash
cswap export backup.cswap                    # All accounts to a file
cswap export backup.cswap --account 2        # One account
cswap export backup.cswap --full             # Include full ~/.claude.json and credential object (same-PC backup)
cswap import backup.cswap                    # Skips accounts that already exist
cswap import backup.cswap --force            # Overwrite existing
```

The export file is plaintext JSON and, by default, carries only each account's own login — machine-shared MCP/plugin OAuth tokens and the device token stay on the source machine (`--full` keeps everything, for same-PC backups). If you need encryption, pipe through your tool of choice (e.g. `cswap export - | gpg -c > backup.gpg`).

If an imported account is the one you're currently logged in as, activate the imported credentials with `cswap switch N --force` (a plain `switch` to the current account is a safe no-op and won't touch the import).

### JSON output for scripting

Add `--json` to `list`, `status`, or `switch` to emit a single machine-readable JSON object on stdout (human-readable notices go to stderr). Useful for scripting auto-swap and quota tracking.

```bash

{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "activeAccountNumber": 2,
  "accounts": [
    { "number": 2, "email": "you@example.com", "active": true, "usageStatus": "ok",
      "usage": { "fiveHour": { "pct": 25.0, "resetsAt": "2026-06-22T23:29:59Z" },

}
```

Every payload carries a `schemaVersion` (currently `1`); on a handled error stdout is `{"schemaVersion":1,"error":{...}}` with a non-zero exit code. `--switch`/`--switch-to` report `{"switched": true|false, "from": …, "to": …, "reason": …}`. `reseed --json` reports `{"reseeded": true|false, "outcome": "reseeded"|"in-sync"|"profile-ahead", "from": "backup"|null, "generation": …, "livePids": [...], "detail": …}`; its refusals carry `error.outcome` (`no-profile`, `active-slot`, `token-profile`, `relogin-required`, …) and `error.livePids` inside the error envelope.

Usage is served from a per-account cache: when the usage API is briefly unreachable, the last-known numbers are shown instead of nothing (the human view marks them with their age, e.g. `· 2m ago`). Rows with decision-trusted usage carry additive `usageFetchedAt`/`usageAgeSeconds` fields telling you how old the measurement is. Once last-good data is too old to drive a decision, `usageStatus` remains `unavailable` and `usage` remains null, while additive `lastGoodUsage`/`lastGoodFetchedAt`/`lastGoodAgeSeconds` fields preserve the human display without making the account actionable. These fields apply to list rows and the managed active row from `status --json`. An account held out of rotation with `cswap disable` carries an additive `"disabled": true` on its row (absent otherwise).

An account row also carries an additive `alias` field once one is set with `cswap alias` (e.g. `"alias": "dev"`); accounts without one simply omit the key.

Weekly windows (`sevenDay` and per-model `scoped` entries — never `fiveHour`) additively carry pace fields once the week is ~a day old: `expectedPct` (where usage would sit if spread evenly across the week) and `aheadOfPace` (`true` when meaningfully above that — the same signal the human views show as an `(ahead)`/`(ahead of pace)` marker). `projectedExhaustionAt`/`willLastToReset` extrapolate the current rate into an ETA to 100% and a yes/no "will it last to the reset"; they stay `--json`-only since a linear projection is too rough to present as fact in the UI.

`cswap auto --json` emits an event *stream* instead — one JSON object per line (`{"schemaVersion":1,"event":"switch","ts":…, …}` with kinds like `poll`, `switch`, `no-switch`, `account-quarantined`, `all-exhausted`, `error`). The contract is additive: new kinds and fields may appear, so scripts should ignore unknown ones.

### Share usage readings between machines

Machines that hold the same accounts can end up spending one usage-endpoint budget: when they share a login (moved between them with `export`/`import`, so the same token is live on each), or when the account's usage requests are limited per account rather than per token. Their polling then adds up. `import-usage` lets one machine poll and hand its readings to the others:

```bash
cswap list --json | ssh laptop cswap import-usage - --hold 600
```

The input is `cswap list --json` output. Each row with `usageStatus: "ok"` is matched to a local account by email and organization, and adopted when it is newer than the reading already stored. Its age comes from `usageAgeSeconds`, so the two machines' clocks never have to agree; a script that delays the hand-over should add the delay to that field. `--hold SECONDS` keeps every collector on the receiving machine (`list`, `status`, `auto`, the dashboard, the menu bar) from fetching those accounts for that long, and the held reading stays trusted for switch decisions meanwhile. A hold never runs past the reading's earliest window reset (per-model windows included), nor past an hour after the reading was taken. Renew it with each hand-over, or lift it early with `--hold 0`; when it lapses, the machine goes back to fetching for itself.

### Add an account from a raw token or API key

If you only have a long-lived setup-token (e.g., produced by `claude setup-token`)
or a managed API key (`sk-ant-api...`) and you don't want to log in via the browser
flow first — useful on headless servers or when receiving a token from another
machine — register it directly. The token type is auto-detected:

```bash
cswap add-token sk-ant-oat01-...             # OAuth setup-token
cswap add-token sk-ant-api03-...             # managed API key
cswap add-token sk-ant-oat01-... --slot 3
cswap add-token - --slot 3                   # read token from stdin
cswap add-token --email user@example.com     # optional label override
```

`--email` is optional; omitted values use `setup-token-{slot}@token.local`
(or `api-key-{slot}@token.local` for API keys). No Anthropic API calls are made.

### Attach a setup-token to a login slot (inference on the token, quota on the login)

A `claude setup-token` is inference-only: the usage endpoint refuses it (403,
`user:profile` scope), so a slot made ONLY of a setup-token is blind to quota.
To keep quota and identity on the ordinary login while sessions run on a
token that never rotates or expires mid-run:

```bash
claude setup-token                    # browser flow; prints the token
cswap attach-token 19 -               # read it from stdin
cswap run 19 -- -p "hello"            # this session runs on the token
cswap list --token-status             # "inference token: attached"
cswap detach-token 19                 # back to the login
```

`list --json` marks such a slot with `"inferenceToken": true` (the value is
never emitted). Removing the account or overwriting its slot drops the token.


**API-key accounts.** An `sk-ant-api...` value registers a managed API-key account
(the kind Claude Code uses after `/login` with a key) rather than an OAuth
setup-token. It switches like any other account; since API keys have no subscription
quota, they show no usage and the usage-aware `switch` strategies never skip them as
rate-limited.
